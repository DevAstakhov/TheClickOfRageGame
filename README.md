# Click of Rage

## What a hell is that

This is a simple game that was created with the only purpose - to learn pure Javascript.

## How to run the game

The game is actually like a site. Just put the content into your favorite web server's site directory and open in a browser (I've only tested in google chrome).

## Rules

You need to break all the blocks. Beat each block 100 times to break it. There is 15 sec is given on a start. Each broken block gives 3 sec. The game end when either all the blocks are broken or the time has expired.
